# Identification-of-Unmasked-Faces-COVID

COVID-19 has been around for more than a year and a half, and it seems like it won't stop anytime soon, with scientists prediciting a third wave hitting the world soon. One important factor for COVID prevention is Face Masks. This repository has scripts to identify masked and unmasked faces using Machine Learning. 

The central concepts used in the project is as
follows:
  1. Face Detection
  2. Supervised Learning
  3. Deep Neural Network
  4. Face Recognition

### Data Set 

The dataset is modifiable, and new folders can be added easily using an option in `project.py`.

The existing dataset looks like this:

**Combo**, **Employees**, **Mask Module**
